I am a technology enthusiast and I believe technology is the key to shape our future and solve our problems. However I also believe in the risks of technology moving a lot faster than humans able to adapt to it, and making the gap only bigger and bigger.

The internet is seen as this eye-opening and world connecting experience, but in many cases it narrows your view through a small LCD window into what is actually happening around you. What makes humans so awesome is the fact that we can build and use tools to better ourselves, but what is even more awesome is that we can think rationally about the effect these tools are having on ourselves and our society, and choose which ones are truly important. I can’t help but fear the future of humankind will be similar to this scene from Wall-E where humans are depicted as complacent and out of shape, and they rely on these automated advanced technologies to move them and feed them while they’re busy living their lives within their tiny screens. Let’s make sure this doesn’t happen. 

We need to remember what truly makes us human and hold onto and nurture these deep social qualities before we all end up being mindless anti-social drones.
