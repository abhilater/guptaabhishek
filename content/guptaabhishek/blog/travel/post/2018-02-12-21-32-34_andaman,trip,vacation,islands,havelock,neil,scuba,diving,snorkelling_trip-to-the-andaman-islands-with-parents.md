I have repeatedly heard a lot about Andaman being one of the must do travel destinations in the country with its flawless virgin beaches, rich coral ecosystem and of course the best place in India for the ones who want to strike off diving from their bucket list. It was always a dream of ours (my wife and me) to witness the beauty of these islands first hand and so it happened by end of last year when my in-laws asked us if we would like to join them in their plans to go to Andaman during the Republic day week. After a short phase of disinclination and reluctance, we decided to go for it. We swiftly did the travel arrangements and itinerary planning for the four of us.

So 6 days, a pair of couples of two different generations, and 5 islands of the Andaman archipelago, it was truly a trip of a lifetime and an awesome family vacation with lots of warm moments
to cherish.

Unlike our trips to the hills in Himachal and Uttarakhand and beach places like Goa or Gokarna where we would be inclined to arrange the logistics and stays on our own mostly at backpacker hostels and home-stays, here after some careful analysis and deliberations we preferred taking the help of a travel company specialising in the Andaman area named Andaman Excursions. They booked us our hotels and also all the logistics and transports.

**Port Blair - Day 1**

Our flight from Kolkata landed at the Veer Savarkar International Airport rightfully named after the patriotic hero of our freedom struggle who had spent a major portion of his life in a tiny cell in the Cellular jail. We visited the Cellular jail in the evening where we had a well informed guide with all the tales and history of the jail and some of the inmates. After a short trip to a Port Blair local beach named Corbyn Cove's beach we returned back to the jail in the late evening to witness a wonderful light and sound show inside the jail compound. The show was an fascinating way to narrate the stories of the sacrifices and tortures dealt in the name of 'Sajaye Kala Pani' as it was called then.

**Havelock Island and Elephant beach - Day 2 & 3**

We had heard a lot about the Radhanagar beach being rated Asia's best beach by some magazine and today we had the opportunity to enjoy it ourselves. It was pristine, blue and clear and we wasted no time in jumping in our swim wear and diving into the shore. In the evening we booked an early morning session of Scuba diving at Beach No. 2. We paid Rs 4000 per head for the same for the early morning time slot.

**First Scuba dive**

Being our first Scuba dive, the experience was whirl wind of all emotions beginning from anxiety at night to excitement in the morning to nervousness during the training session and pre-dive, a little fear and panic at the point of actual dive followed by amazement and nirvana after a while with the views of the beautiful coral reefs at the depth of 12 m, ending with a feeling of pride and accomplishment.

**Elephant Beach**
Probably the most pristine virgin beach with the most amazing and untouched coral reefs that is just a short speed boat ride away from Havelock. It was sheer pleasure being at this beach at the best possible weather that encouraged us to remain a little longer in the greenish blue waters, swimming and snorkelling with the white stripped clown fishes that are in abundance here. All four of us simply enjoyed our snorkelling sessions through the coral reef.

**Neil Island - Day 4**

A pretty luxurious cruise called Macruzz Gold took us from Havelock to Neil in the morning. Being a day trip at Neil island, we planned to see the three main beaches i.e. The natural bridge formation at Laxmanpur beach 1, The Laxmanpur beach 2 with beautiful sea side corals followed by the buzzing Bharatpur beach with shit loads of water sports. Took the afternoon cruise back to Port Blair.

**Ross island and North Bay Islands - Day 5**

At the last leg of our Andaman island hopping was a tour of the Ross Island followed by the North Bay Island that are situated at a sea distance of about 15 km from Port Blair. The boat ride was through a relatively more choppy waters than what we have been experiencing in and around Havelock and Neil. 
Ross Island being at a strategic location is currently under the control of Indian Navy. It hosts the architectural remains from the time the island used to be the capital if the British colony in the archipelago.

North Bay is another island bestowed with beautiful coral reefs spanning large sea areas around the island and beautiful beaches with some Scuba and snorkelling activities going on. We took an opportunity to enjoy a superfast Dophin ship ride that had a magnifying glass at its bottom to see deep under the sea corals with a well-informed guide narrating the sea life like our very own David Attenborough.

Dilapidated buildings and remains of the British era at Ross Island, the island had a church, administrative block, sea water distillery plant and bunkers created later by the Japanese occupation

**Port Blair local sightseeing - Day 6**

Before our flight back we took the opportunity to explore Port Blair and its anthropology museum which I really loved. Also, I do recommend buying your corals, sea shells and other gift items from Sagarika Emporium in Port Blair market and remember to get an invoice which is needed if you are stopped at the airport.
